# Garage Control PCB
## Wemos D1 Mini Shield to control one or two garage doors.

Last year I made my 30 year old dumb garage door opener a bit smarter by adding a wifi connected button and sensor.
I have wanted to move from my prototype board to a proper PCB to make it look nicer, practice some SMD soldering, 
and get some more PCB layout experience. This is the fulfillment of those desires.
